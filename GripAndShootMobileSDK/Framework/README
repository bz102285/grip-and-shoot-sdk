This folder contains three objects:

1) GripAndShootSDK.framework
2) system.json
3) grip_and_shoot.json

# Installation

1) Import GripAndShootSDK.framework just like you would any other .framework file
2) Add both system.json and grip_and_shoot.json to your project's main bundle

NOTE: this framework uses objective-c categories.  To load them, add “-ObjC” to “Other Linker Flags” in your project’s build settings.
